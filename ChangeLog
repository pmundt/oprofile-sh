	* libpp/symbol.h:
	* libutil++/Makefile.am:
	* libutil++/sparse_array.h: represent count_array_t as a sparse 
	  array type based on std::map rather than growable_vector which is
	  based on std::vector to reduce the excessive heap usage on large
	  profiles.

	* daemon/opd_anon.h:
	* daemon/opd_mangling.c:
	* libop/op_mangle.c:
	* libop/op_mangle.h:
	* libpp/parse_filename.cpp: save and report name of anonymous
	  mapping if there is one (as self-contradictory as that
	  sounds).

	  by oprofile.

	* libpp/xml_utils.cpp: opreport -X was still getting some incorrect 
	  symbols attributed to the <binary> when processing a --separate=lib
	  profile.

	* daemon/oprofiled.c: no need for 0755 for the log file mode, use 0644
	* utils/opcontrol: don't create the log in opcontrol

2007-01-26  Dave Nomura <dcnltc@us.ibm.com>

	* libpp/format_output.cpp:
	* libpp/xml_utils.cpp: opreport -X was mixing the symbols associated with
	  an application with those of a library when processing a --separate=lib
	  profile.
