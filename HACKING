And when you drive for hours, arrive to find you nowhere gone, you've just been
mouthing "brum, brum", rocking wheel, of course you have, the heap is rusted
through and off the road since you drove drunk through thirteen school yards,
laughing like Prescott.

Then welcome, ah, oo costrinzi welcome, in OProfile.
