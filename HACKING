And when you drive for hours, arrive to find you nowhere gone, you've just been
mouthing "brum, brum", rocking wheel, of course you have, the heap is rusted
through and off the road since you drove drunk through thirteen school yards,
laughing like Prescott.

Then welcome, ah, oo costrinzi welcome, in OProfile.

Please talk to the list before starting on something. We're not too scary.

Here's a short list of some stuff you need to know to get started. Don't forget
to read doc/CodingStyle

Source organisation
-------------------

module/

	The 2.4 module code. Sub-directories contain architecture-specific code.

dae/

	The 2.4 daemon which writes the kernel data to the sample files.

daemon/

	The 2.5+ daemon

utils/

	Scripts for managing the daemon etc.

doc/

	User and developer documentation

pp/

	The post-profiling tools for showing results

libabi/

	op_import and its ABI support library

libdb/

	The sample file access library

libop/

	C language oprofile-specific helper stuff

libop++/

	C++ oprofile-specific helper stuff

libopt++/

	A simple C++ library for parsing command lines

libutil/
libutil++/

	Generic helpers

gui/

	The GUI for starting oprofile

Tools
-----

You'll need autoconf 2.13+ and automake 2.5+ when using CVS. Don't forget to
autogen.sh first.

We still currently support gcc 2.91.66. Please bear this in mind.

Making patches, commit rights
-----------------------------

Patches should be in diff -u format, appliable by patch -p1 in the top-level
source directory. Patches should not include changes to generated files.

Even trivial patches must have a change log entry in the usual format (see
ChangeLog). Refer to bug numbers in the change log if relevant.

You may after a while be given direct commit rights. You should be subscribed
to both the main list and the commits mailing list if you do. Your cvs commit
message only needs to briefly describe what your change does - the change log
should have the detailed description. Any non-trivial change needs approval
from either John or Phil, unless stated otherwise. The CVS tree will freeze
occassionally for release, in which case no commits are allowed at all without
agreement of John and Phil.
